1. 'simulate_data.R' - functions for simulating data for the MM-LDA model
2. 'mmlda.R' - functions for MM-LDA model using collapsed Gibbs sampling
3. 'stan-mmlda.R' - functions for MM-LDA model using stan
4. 'mm_lda.stan' - stan code for MM-LDA
5. 'mmlda.rds' - model object created by stan, must delete running code on a new
                computer
6. 'bagel_plts.R' - code for plotting MM-LDA using plots from BAGEL
