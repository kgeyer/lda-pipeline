4. 'generate_data.R' - Simulates data for tests
5. 'lda_test.py' - Tests LDA models written in Python
6. 'lda_test.R' - Tests LDA models written in R
7. 'mmlda_test.py' - Tests MM-LDA models written in Python
8. 'mmlda_test.R' - Tests MM-LDA models written in R
9. 'evaluate_lda_results.R' - Generates evaluation metrics and plots for LDA
10. 'evaluate_mmlda_results.R' - Generates evaluation metrics and plots for MM-LDA
11. 'test_LDA_pyMC3.ipynb' - Notebook for testing LDA
12. 'test_MMLDA_pyMC3.ipynb' - Notebook for testing MM-LDA

configure pyMC3 by loading a Python environment file. Directions for configuring
MacOS and Linux, as well as the environment files, are provided with this GitLab
project.

To run the test locally, edit the variables in 'local.bash' and run the
following:
